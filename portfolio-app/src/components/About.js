               My name is KABUNDI TSHISUAKA. I also go by Bertin Tshisuaka as well. I am currently a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology
               Bootcamp for Fullstack Web Development. I did not initially come from a background in Software and IT. My previous experience mainly
               consisted of electrical/mechanical/maintenance engineering, where I worked for many years. But, I also did go to university for a 
               degree in Software Engineering, where I was exposed to a lot of what I know now. I am a great reader, and I love to learn a lot. 
               Anything that can expand my knowledge, I like to take on.
